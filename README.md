# Scripts and Macros for Adafruit MacroPad

[Initial code adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040) 

* Added my own macros for:
  * Function keys
  * Numpad
  * Mouse
  * B flat minor tones
  * Added a numeric prefix to fix the order of macros selected by rotary encoder

* Customized colors

To create your own macros follow templates from existing macros in \macros folder

* Next steps:
  * Add macros based on absolute rotary encoder position instead of relative position
